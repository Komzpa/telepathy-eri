class ChannelInterfaceCaptchaAuthentication(dbus.service.Interface):
    """\
      A channel interface for captcha authentication.
        When this interface appears on a ServerAuthentication
        channel, it represents authentication with the server. In future,
        it could also be used to authenticate with secondary services,
        or even to authenticate end-to-end connections with contacts. As a result,
        this interface does not REQUIRE ServerAuthentication to allow for a potential future
        Channel.Type.PeerAuthentication interface.

      In any protocol that requires a captcha, the connection manager can
        use this channel to let a user interface carry out a simple captcha
        handshake with it, as a way to test the user is human
        interactively.

      For channels managed by a
        ChannelDispatcher,
        only the channel's Handler may call the
        methods on this interface. Other clients MAY observe the
        authentication process by watching its signals and properties.

      The most commonly used form of captcha challenge is OCR (recognition
        of distorted letters or words in an image), but for accessibility
        reasons, this interface also allows various other types of challenge,
        such as plain-text questions or recognition of words in audio. Its
        structure is modelled on XMPP's
        XEP-0158,
        but can be used with other protocols by mapping their semantics
        into those used in XMPP.

      
        It is important to support multiple types of captcha
          challenge to avoid discriminating against certain users; for
          instance, blind or partially-sighted users cannot be expected
          to answer an OCR challenge.

        XEP-0158 supports a superset of all other known protocols' captcha
          interfaces, and is sufficiently elaborate that we expect it will
          continue to do so.

        There can only be one Handler, which is a good fit for the
          question/answer model implied by captchas.

        Gets information regarding each of the captcha methods
          available and which and how many need to be successfully answered

        To call this method successfully, the state must be Local_Pending
          or Try_Again. If it is Local_Pending, it remains Local_Pending. If
          called more than once while in Local_Pending state, or if the state
          is Try_Again, this method fetches a new set of captcha challenges,
          if possible, and the state returns to Local_Pending.

        
          For instance, you could call GetCaptchas again from Local_Pending
            state if the user indicates that they can't understand the
            initially-offered captcha.

          This is a method, not a property, so that it can be used to
            fetch more than one set of captcha challenges, and so that
            change notification is not required. Only the Handler should
            call this method and calling GetAll would not reduce round-trips,
            so the usual reasons to prefer a property do not apply here.
