      An interface for protocols that support multiple forms of
        addressing contacts, for example through vCard addresses and URIs.

      If the ConnectionManager has a .manager file, and it
        supports this interface, the interface's immutable properties
        must be represented in the file; the representation is described as
        part of the documentation for each property.

      For instance, a SIP connection manager might have the
        following lines in the .manager file.


[Protocol sip]
AddressableVCardFields=tel;x-sip;
AddressableURISchemes=tel;sip;

        If full normalization requires network activity or is otherwise
          impossible to do without a Connection,
          this method SHOULD perform a best-effort normalization.

        An example would be a vCard TEL field with a formatted
          number in the form of +1 (206) 555 1234, this would be
          normalized to +12065551234.

        Attempt to normalize the given contact URI. Where possible, this
          SHOULD return an address that would appear in the

        If full normalization requires network activity or is otherwise
          impossible to do without a Connection,
          this method SHOULD perform a best-effort normalization.

        If the URI has extra information beyond what's necessary to
          identify a particular contact, such as an XMPP resource or an
          action to carry out, this extra information SHOULD be removed.
          If all URIs in a scheme contain a verb or action
          (like aim, ymsgr and
          msnim URIs), then the verb SHOULD be replaced
          with the one specified in
          AddressableURISchemes.

        
          This method is intended to normalize URIs stored in address
            books, for instance. In protocols like XMPP, if you
            vary the resource or action (query string), the URI still
            refers to the same high-level contact.
        

        For instance,
          xmpp:romeo@Example.Com/Empathy?message;body=Hello
          would be normalized to xmpp:romeo@example.com,
          and aim:goim?screenname=Romeo%20M&message=Hello
          would be normalized to
          aim:addbuddy?screenname=romeom.
